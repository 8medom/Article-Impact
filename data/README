Data from BBC discussions, collected by Matus Medo (matus.medo@unifr.ch) from September 26, 2018.
The data can be used for research. In that case, please cite https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05955 in
your work using this dataset. Please do not spread further without including this README file.

The main file (BBC_discussions.dat) contains data about individual comments in sport discussions
on the BBC website (main web, www.bbc.com/sport, and the sub-pages corresponding to individual
sports such as www.bbc.com/sport/cricket). For each comment, we store to which news it belongs,
who wrote it, which in the sequence of all comments (of the given news) it is, its exact time,
length of the comment (in characters), and the number of up- and down-votes it received.
Comments that have been removed by the BBC editors have nan in the last three columns. To agree
with the BBC numbering, comments for an individual news article are numbered from 1. Comments
that have been removed by the BBC editors (https://www.bbc.co.uk/social/moderation/house-rules
summarizes the rules that apply in BBC discussions) have "nan" as their length, as well as the
number of up- and down-votes. The comment time and author remain available.

I assigned new unique IDs to news that are now numbered from 0. To make everyone's life easier,
news are numbered by the first comment that they receive (I use that rather than the news
publication date because we know the date AND time for the former, but only the date for the
latter). File news-BBC_vs_ID.dat lists basic information (BBC ID, sport section, and title), for
each of them. For example, news 0 with ID 42070352 corresponds to the section snooker and can be
accessed online at www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/42070352.

I also assigned new unique IDs to users who are now numbered from 0. File users-BBC_vs_ID.dat
lists basic user information (BBC ID and name), even if it is unlikely to be really useful.

If you have any questions or spot some irregularities in the data, please let me know!
